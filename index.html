 <h2>Sheamar White</h2>
 <p>Hello, my name is Sheamar White and my intrest in Web Development stems from my desire to know as much as I can about the technology we use in our daily lives. MY high school invited someone to our school to have a class on html and I attended. At the class, I learnt aspects of typing script and code that I still use to this day. Ever since, I have this undying urge to learn and understand each and every aspect of computers, so that there is no technological problem that could phase me.</p>
